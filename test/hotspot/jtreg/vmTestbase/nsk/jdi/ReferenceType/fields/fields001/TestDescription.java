 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ReferenceType/fields/fields001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *         nsk/jdi/ReferenceType/fields/fields001 test
 *         checks the fields() method of ReferenceType interface
 *         of the com.sun.jdi package :
 *        the ReferenceType.fields() method is checked for fields of
 *        debugee's class which extends super class and implements interface.
 *        The test expects that only declared directly in the checked class
 *        fields should be included in Field list returned by the fields() method.
 *        Each field is checked for field name, field type, static modifier
 *        and declaring class.
 * COMMENTS
 *         Fixed test due to bug:
 *         Incorrect initialization of Binder object with argv instead of argHandler.
